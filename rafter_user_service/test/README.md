### Testing Structure
The structure of this directory is meant to mirror that of
`rafter_user_service`.  Therefore, if there is a subpackage
`rafter_user_service/models/`, there should be an analogous
`rafter_user_service/test/test_models/`.  Likewise, single files such as
`rafter_user_service/signals.py` should have single test files,
`rafter_user_service/test/test_signals.py`.
